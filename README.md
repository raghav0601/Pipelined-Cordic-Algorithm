# Pipelined-Cordic-Algorithm
this GitHub repository contains an RTL (Register-Transfer Level) implementation of the Cordic algorithm, a popular method for efficiently computing trigonometric functions and vector rotations. The Cordic algorithm is implemented in Verilog and targets hardware description languages.

Module Description:
The module is named cordic_des and takes several inputs and outputs:

clk: Clock input for synchronous operation.
xin: Input signed 16-bit data representing the X-coordinate of the initial vector.
yin: Input signed 16-bit data representing the Y-coordinate of the initial vector.
angle: Input signed 32-bit data representing the rotation angle in radians.
xout: Output signed 16-bit data representing the X-coordinate of the rotated vector.
yout: Output signed 16-bit data representing the Y-coordinate of the rotated vector.
Implementation Details:

The module initializes constants for the arctangent values for angles from 0 to 45 degrees, precomputed as fixed-point numbers.
The module processes the input angle to identify the quadrant and performs initializations accordingly for the starting X and Y coordinates.
The Cordic algorithm is iteratively executed using a loop (generated in this case) to approximate the vector rotation and compute the sine and cosine values.
The output X and Y coordinates after the iterations represent the rotated vector.
Important Notes:

The width parameter is set to 16, indicating the precision of the fixed-point representation used for calculations.
The Cordic iterations are performed in a pipelined manner, allowing efficient hardware implementation.
